# Ember JS Test Finder Extension

A VS Code extension to quickly find and open test files for Ember.js projects

## Features

- Hold `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Win/Linux) and double tap `T` to find tests for the current file
- Single test file opens immediately
- Multiple test files show a selection list

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Run the following and then restart VS Code / Cursor

```bash
cd ~/test-finder && ./install.sh --cursor
# or
cd ~/test-finder && ./install.sh --code
```

The installer is safe to run repeatedly. It will:

- Detect changes in `src/**/*.ts` and recompile only when needed
- Copy the fresh build and README into your editor's extensions folder
- Ensure `find-all-tests.sh` is executable
- Prompt you to reload your editor for changes to take effect

### Manual Installation

Run the following and then restart VS Code / Cursor

```bash
cd ~/test-finder && npm install && npm run compile
EXT_DIR=~/.vscode/extensions/local.ember-js-test-finder-1.0.0
rm -rf "$EXT_DIR" && mkdir -p "$EXT_DIR"
cp -r out "$EXT_DIR/" && cp package.json README.md find-all-tests.sh "$EXT_DIR/"
chmod +x "$EXT_DIR/find-all-tests.sh"
```

### Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vscode/extensions/local.ember-js-test-finder-1.0.0
rm -rf ~/.cursor/extensions/local.ember-js-test-finder-1.0.0
```

## Usage

1. Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in your Ember `app/` directory
2. Press `Cmd+T, Cmd+T` (Mac) or `Ctrl+T, Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux)
3. Select a test file from the list (if multiple exist)
4. The test file opens in the editor

## Supported File Types

The extension follows Ember's standard test conventions:

### Integration Tests (typically in `tests/integration/`)

- **Components** - Primary test type for components
- **Helpers** - Primary test type for helpers
- **Modifiers** - Primary test type for modifiers

### Unit Tests (typically in `tests/unit/`)

- **Models** - Data model tests
- **Services** - Service layer tests
- **Routes** - Route handler tests
- **Controllers** - Controller logic tests
- **Adapters** - Data adapter tests
- **Serializers** - Data serialization tests
- **Mixins** - Mixin functionality tests
- **Initializers** - App initializer tests
- **Instance Initializers** - Instance initializer tests
- **Transforms** - Data transform tests
- **Utils** - Utility function tests

### Both Integration and Unit Tests

- Components, helpers, and modifiers can have both test types
- The extension will find all existing test files

## How It Works

The extension:

1. Detects your Ember project root by finding the `app/` and `tests/` directories
2. Determines the file type based on its location in the `app/` directory
3. Looks for corresponding test files following Ember conventions
4. Supports both `.js` and `.ts` files

## Error Messages

- **No test files found**: The file has no associated test files
- **Not a TypeScript or JavaScript file**: Only `.ts` and `.js` files are supported
- **Not in an Ember app/ directory**: File must be in an Ember `app/` directory
- **Cannot find Ember project root**: Could not locate both `app/` and `tests/` directories
- **Missing app/ or tests/ directory**: Ember project structure is incomplete

## Development

To modify the extension:

1. Edit files in the `src/` directory
2. Reinstall to auto-compile and deploy (see [Installation](#installation))

3. Reload your editor window (Command Palette â†’ "Developer: Reload Window")

## Customization

To change the keyboard shortcut:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Cmd+,` or `Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for "Keyboard Shortcuts"
3. Search for "Find Tests for Current File"
4. Click the pencil icon to edit the shortcut
